# Aotearoa NZ Health Data Source Review Project
This project collected sources of health data available in Aotearoa New Zealand, making the list of data sources available through a public website. Each data source includes information about its contents and how to access it.

View the project's website at https://tewhatuora.github.io/data-sources-review.

This resource was created through a research project originally supported by Precision Driven Health, a NZ health data science collaboration from 2016-2023. Te Whatu Ora hosts this information on behalf of the NZ health system.
