Disability statistics give you information about the number of disabled children and adults living in New Zealand. Find out about the nature and cause of impairments, the type of support needed, and how well disabled people are faring compared with non-disabled people. 

You can also find information about:

- who cares for disabled people and what support they provide
- disabled people's education, work, travel, and transport experiences
- experiences of different groups of the population (eg ethnic groups)
