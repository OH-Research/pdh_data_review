Cost/price data? The finance & expenditure part of the submission includes a range of health care financing & expenditure indicators. OECD converts some of the data provided sometimes sourcing external economic and demographic reference data to calculate indicators such: burden of out-of-pocket health expenditure, pharaceutical expenditure as %of GDP, long-term care expenditure. These indicators can then be accessed in the online database OECD.stat or through 'frequently requested data' http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,3746,en_2649_33929_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html an XL workbook downloadable off the OECD website, or out of the biennial OECD Health at a Glance publication (last one was for 2011). Such derived variables are also regarded as part of the OECD Health Data collection.</td> </tr>
