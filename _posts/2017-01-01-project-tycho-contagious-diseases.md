The Project Tycho database (level one) includes standardized counts at the state level for smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, and whooping cough from weekly National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) reports for the United States. The time period of data varies per disease somewhere between 1916 and 2010.
