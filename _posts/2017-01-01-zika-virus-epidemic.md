An outbreak of the Zika virus, an infection transmitted mostly by the Aedes species mosquito (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus), has been sweeping across the Americas and the Pacific since mid-2015. Although first isolated in 1947 in Uganda, a lack of previous research has challenged the scientific community to quickly understand its devastating effects as the epidemic continues to spread.
