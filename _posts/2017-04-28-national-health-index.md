 <h4> <u>Description:</u> </h4>
The National Health Index number (NHI number) is a unique number that is assigned to each person using health and disability support services. The NHI is an index of information associated with that unique number. 
The NHI holds the following information: name (including alternative names such as maiden names), NHI number, address, date of birth, sex, New Zealand resident status, ethnicity; date of death, and flags indicating any medical warnings or donor information. Clinical information is not recorded on the NHI.
