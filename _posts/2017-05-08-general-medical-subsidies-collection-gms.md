description: The General Medical Subsidies Collection contains data on the fee-for-service
  payments made to doctors for patient visits. It is used to monitor contracts with
  providers, to support the forecasting and setting of budgets and to enable the analysis
  of health needs. Originally, almost all patient visits to general practitioners
  would have resulted in a fee-for-service GMS claim. However since 2003, capitation
  payments made via Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) have progressively replaced
  fee-for-service claiming. Now GMS claims are made of only a limited number of patient
  visits of specific types.
