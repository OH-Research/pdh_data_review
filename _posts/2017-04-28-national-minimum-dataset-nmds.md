 <h4> <u>Description:</u> </h4>
The NMDS is a national collection of public and private hospital discharge information, including clinical information, for inpatients and day patients.
Data has been submitted electronically in an agreed format by public hospitals since 1993; and back-loaded with public hospital discharge information from 1988.
The private hospital discharge information for publicly funded events, eg, birth events and geriatric care, has been collected since 1997. Other data is being added as it becomes available electronically.
