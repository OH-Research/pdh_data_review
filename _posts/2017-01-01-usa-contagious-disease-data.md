This public data is published by the US Department of Health and Human Services and includes all weekly surveillance reports of nationally notifiable diseases for all U.S. cities and states published between 1888 and 2013. The data set consists of eight important vaccine-preventable contagious diseases: diphtheria, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella and smallpox.
