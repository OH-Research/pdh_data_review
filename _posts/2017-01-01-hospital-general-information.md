This file contains general information about all hospitals that have been registered with Medicare, including their addresses, type of hospital, and ownership structure. It also contains information about the quality of each hospital, in the form of an overall rating (1-5, where 5 is the best possible rating & 1 is the worst), and whether the hospital scored above, same as, or below the national average for a variety of measures.
