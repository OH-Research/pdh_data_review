title: General Medical Subsidies Collection (GMS)
---


 <h4> <u>Description:</u> </h4>
The General Medical Subsidies Collection contains data on the fee-for-service payments made to doctors for patient visits. It is used to monitor contracts with providers, to support the forecasting and setting of budgets and to enable the analysis of health needs. Originally, almost all patient visits to general practitioners would have resulted in a fee-for-service GMS claim. However since 2003, capitation payments made via Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) have progressively replaced fee-for-service claiming. Now GMS claims are made of only a limited number of patient visits of specific types.
