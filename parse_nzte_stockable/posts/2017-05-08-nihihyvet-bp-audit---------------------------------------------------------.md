 <tr> <td width="40%">Volume of data (e.g. how many records)
Since when?</td> <td>Participant#=3068; Data Form#=3068; study period (longitudinal data?): 5 yrs</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td width="40%">Purpose and governance including ethics committee/patient consent mechanisms. Q: How do you get around ethics/privacy issues with your data sources? Esp. DHBs?</td> <td>DB (access) is governed by HYVET BP AUDIT Monitoring Committee</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td width="40%">Scope</td> <td>Cohort</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td width="40%">How quickly can the data be made available from time of request and how old is the data once it is made available</td> <td>HG: Possibly slow, if possible at all, as NIHI (and most other trial researchers) often specifies in participant consent form that the data isn't going to be used, even in an unidentifiable way, for other purposes than the study without further participant consent.</td> </tr>
