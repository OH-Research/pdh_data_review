 <h4> <u>Description:</u> </h4>
The New Zealand Youth Tobacco Monitor (NZYTM) is a collaborative research project between the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC) and Action on Smoking andHealth (ASH). The NZYTM helps to inform and evaluate policy and activities to reduce tobacco use, such as recent laws to ban tobacco retail displays, tobacco tax increases and HSC’s ‘Smoking Not Our Future’ campaign. The NZYTM compromises: •  The ASH Year 10 Snapshot Survey, an annual tobacco-use survey of around 30,000 year 10 students throughout New Zealand which has been running for over a decade. (See 64 & 64.1 ASH Year 10 Survey) •  The HSC’s Youth Insights Survey (YIS), conducted every two years with around 3,000 year 10 students throughout New Zealand, which has been running since 2000. The Youth Insights Survey monitors the broad spectrum of risk and protective factors that relate to the number of young people in New Zealand taking up smoking.
