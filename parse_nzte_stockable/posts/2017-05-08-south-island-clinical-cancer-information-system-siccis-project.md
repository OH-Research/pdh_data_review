 <h4> <u>Description:</u> </h4>
The goal of the project is to develop a South Island-wide Cancer Registry (METRIQ) that utilises MOSAIQ, the patient management system used by all three South Island cancer centres, Christchurch and Dunedin public cancer centres and St George’s private cancer centre. This project will provide shared learning with the North Island Cancer Centres who have MOSAIQ with the potential for them to link to the METRIQ Cancer Registry in the future.
SICCIS Goals:
To improve collection, storage, and accessibility of cancer data (from first specialist assessment and staging, through planning, treatment, follow-up, and long-term survivorship) for clinicians, cancer researchers, and funders and planners
To foster regional collaboration and cooperation between clinicians, planners and funders
To facilitate inter-cancer centre access to cancer data on the South Island
