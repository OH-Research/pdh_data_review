Researchers requiring identifiable data will usually need approval from an Ethics Committee. Customised datasets or summary reports are available on request, either electronically or on paper. Staff from the Analytical Services team can help to define the specifications for a request and are familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the data.</td> </tr>
